                </ul>

            <h3>Garlic Butter Topping</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 tbsp butter, melted</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Naan Bread</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine together the water, sugar and yeast. Let sit for 5-10 minutes or until the mixture begins to bubble on top</li>
                    <li>Add in the milk, yogurt, oil, minced garlic, flour baking powder and salt. Mix until the dough comes together with your hands.</li>
                    <li>Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Use floured hands to knead the dough until smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Lightly grease the same mixing bowl with a small spray of cooking oil. Transfer dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for about an hour until doubled in size.</li>
                    <li>When ready to cook, divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Roll into balls, then use a rolling pin to roll each piece of dough into a large oval, about 6-inches long and ⅛-inch thick. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Grease skillet all over with ½ teaspoon of the extra oil.</li>
                    <li>Place one piece of the naan on the oiled hot skillet and cook until bubbles form on top, about 1-2 minutes. While cooking, brush the top with a little oil.</li>
                    <li>Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until large golden spots appear on the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the skillet and wrap in a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining naan (keep them wrapped in a towel while you work).</li>
                </ol>
            
            <h3>Garlic Butter Topping</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine melted butter and minced garlic together in a bowl. Brush each naan with the garlic butter and top with the fresh herb of your choosing.</li>
                </ol>
