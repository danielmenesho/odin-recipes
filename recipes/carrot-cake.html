          <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <h3>Carrot Cake</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 325Â°F and line a 9x13" cake pan with parchment paper (covering the sides)</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars and oil. Add the eggs, vanilla, sour cream, and applesauce, mixing well after each addition. <p>Scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary</p></li>
                    <li>Sift and fold the flour mixture into the wet ingredients just until a few dry streaks are visible. Then, fold in the shredded carrots.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely before frosting. <p>Once the cake has cooled, feel free to lift it out of the pan by grabbing the edges of the parchment paper.</p></li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Brown Butter Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the butter in a pan over medium heat. Stir until the butter brown and releases a nutty aroma. Let it cool.</li>
                    <li>Mix the cream cheese in a large bowl. Stir in the cooled brown butter, vanilla, and powdered sugar until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Spread an even layer of frosting over the cooled carrot cake. Cut into 24 pieces (or less for bigger slices) and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
